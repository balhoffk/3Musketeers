PROJECT 2: ETL
GROUP NAME: 3 MUSKETEERS


1. E - WHAT WERE OUR ORIGNAL DATA SOURCES AND HOW THE DATA FORMATTED?

	We pulled our data from the following websites:
	
		Baseball defense & offensive stats: https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2015.shtml#teams_standard_pitching::none
		
		Attendance by team by year:
		https://www.kaggle.com/timschutzyang/dataset1/version/1#baseballdata.csv
		
		Team Data Map Source:
		https://www.smartfantasybaseball.com/2015/09/new-tool-mlb-team-id-map/
		
		Team Payroll Data by Year:
		https://github.com/glamp/mlb-payroll-and-wins
		Data sourced from FiveThirtyEight
		
	All of our datasets were CSV files
	
	
2. T - WHAT TRANSFORMATION WAS NEEDED FOR THE DATA? (CLEANING, JOINING, ETC.)

	The offensive and defensive datasets both had many more data points than we needed, we slimmed down the stats to only 5 different stats for each. We also had to get rid of a two rows, a NaN and an average row. We also renamed the columns from the original acronyms to what the acronyms stand for (Tm to Team, SV to Saves, etc._)
	
	The Attendence by team had over 5 years of data, we were only looking for 2015 so all other years were filtered out.
	
	The Team Map Data Source contained the abbreviations commonly used for several baseball data websites. These included Fangraphs, Baseball Reference, FanDuel, DraftKings, Yahoo!, ESPN, FantasyPros, BaseballPress, Baseball Prospectus, Rotowire. We used excel formulas to update the team name list to convert to proper format, remove the MLB indicator, and remove all hyphens.
	
	Team Salary Data was taken from FiveThirtyEight research (originally scraped from Baseball Reference). We cloned the repository to our desktop and took the salary data from the mlb-payroll-and-wins CSV file, and then added that to our files. By using the "tm" indicatory, we can join the salary data with our other files using the BBREF team abbrevation.
	
	
	
3. L - Describe the final database, tables/collections and why were they choosen

	We end up with four different SQL databases:
		1. Batting stats
		2. Defensive stats
		3. Attendance by team
		4. Team Acronym to team name
		
	Each database can be joined by team name/acronym. We can create all kinds of different baseball stats anaylsis vs game attendence for each team in 2015.
