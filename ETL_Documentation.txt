PROJECT 2: ETL
GROUP NAME: 3 MUSKETEERS


1. E - WHAT WERE OUR ORIGNAL DATA SOURCES AND HOW THE DATA FORMATTED?

	We pulled our data from the below websites:
	
		Baseball defense & offensive stats:https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/MLB/2015.shtml#teams_standard_pitching::none
		
		Attendence by team by year:
		https://www.kaggle.com/timschutzyang/dataset1/version/1#baseballdata.csv
		
		
	Both of our datasets were CSV files
	
	
2. T - WHAT TRANSFORMATION WAS NEEDED FOR THE DATA? (CLEANING, JOINING, ETC.)

	The offensive and defensive datasets both had many more data points than we needed, we slimmed down the stats to only 5 different stats for each. We also had to get rid of a two rows, a NaN and an average row. We also renamed the columns from the original acronyms to what the acronyms stand for (Tm to Team, SV to Saves, etc._)
	
	The Attendence by team had over 5 years of data, we were only looking for 2015 so all other years were filtered out.
	
	
	
3. L - Describe the final database, tables/collections and why were they choosen

	We end up with four different SQL databases:
		1. Batting stats
		2. Defensive stats
		3. Attendence by team
		4. Team Acronym to team name
		
	Each database can be joined by team name/acronym. We can create all kinds of different baseball stats anaylsis vs game attendence for each team in 2015.
